# Mercenary

Mercenary is an opinionated Markdown rendering component for React. It is built on top of the popular `react-markdown` package.

It includes:

- Syntax highlighting with Shiki
- Embedding of URLs
- Hijacks code-block syntax with custom directives for other features

## Installation and usage

```bash
yarn add @doom.sh/mercenary
```

```ts
import Mercenary, { MercenaryProps } from "@doom.sh/mercenary";
```

Mercenary is ESM only. Please make sure you are using versions of NextJS ([see here if using an older version](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66246141)) and React that support ESM.

## Why I built it

Remark/rehype plugins are useful when rendering Markdown, but these plugins vary in quality and sometimes become unmaintained. They also prescribe varying conventions for extending markdown syntax (e.g. code blocks line highlighting). Secondly, rehype plugins tend to annotate the generated HTML with classnames that pollute global scope. I would prefer to render my Markdown with encapsulated React components as much as possible.

After jumping from plugin to plugin for various use-cases, and having to keep updating my Markdown and CSS source files as a result, I decided to build Mercenary so I can standardize on my own conventions for extending Markdown syntax with React components.

The only thing Mercenary expects is GFM-flavored Markdown. It does not allow any other remark/rehype plugins.
